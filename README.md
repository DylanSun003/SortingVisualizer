# SortingVisualizer

A Sorting Visualizer Java project that was developed during my study at college when I was a teaching assistant in a data structure and algorithm class. This project with animation aided to help students in my class to visualize some common sorting algorithms such as quick sort, Merge sort, and Bubble sort, etc so that to solidify their understanding of each sorting and how they work.

### How to use:

Since I already packaged the app into jar file and use the Linux script to run the app. You can directly do the below process to run the app on your machine:

1. Download the SortingProject_jar directory to your local machine

2. Go to terminal and navigate to the SortingProject_jar directory on your machine

3. May need to change the execution access of the app file by typing: *chmod 744 app*

4. Then type this command on the terminal: *./app*


### Enjoy and happy learning!
